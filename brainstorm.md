### Spell Ideas ###
- __Link__ - OF COURSE
- __Portal__ - Similar to swap except it leaves a portal at origin & destination for a few seconds after that transports players & projectiles
- __Gravity__ - Pulls things towards it

### Random ###
- __Player-lava detection__ - Create & Use a seperate smaller eliptical hitbox at the players feet (only needs to be server-side) to detect collision with lava

### Look at TODOs!!! ###
