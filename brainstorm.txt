Handling player on player collisions
 -- Would like them to bounce away from each other sensically
 -- Currently it seems to translate them correctly, but does not update the players velocity
 -- Could this be because the player's own updates are overriding the servers new change in velocity?
 -- Check out anti-cheat function handles this atm, the server MUST be authorative over the client in situations like this
 -- Can I do one sweeping fix to make server-based changes STICK?
